3Dmol.js is an object-oriented, webGL based JavaScript library for online molecular visualization - No Java required!

Since 3Dmol.js is licensed under the permissive BSD open-source license, you are free to use it in any project, as long the code is properly acknowledged and [cited](http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btu829).

With 3Dmol.js, you can add beautifully rendered molecular visualizations to your web applications. Features include:
* support for pdb, sdf, mol2, xyz, and cube formats
* parallelized molecular surface computation
* sphere, stick, line, cross, cartoon, and surface styles
* atom property based selection and styling
* labels
* clickable interactivity with molecular data
* geometric shapes including spheres and arrows

See the [documentation](https://3dmol.csb.pitt.edu/doc/index.html) to learn how to use 3Dmol.js as a hosted viewer, embeddable viewer, or as a component of a larger application.

## Examples

#### PDB
We support the use of both PDB queries as well as PDB files.

First you simply create the viewer with a div's id.
```javascript
var viewer = $3Dmol.createViewer($("#div"));
```
Then you can download a protein data bank model (here pdb:1MO8) and display it with the styling of your choosing.

```javascript
$3Dmol.download("pdb:1MO8",viewer,{multimodel:true, frames:true},function(){
	viewer.setStyle({}, {cartoon:{color:"spectrum"}});
	viewer.render();
});

```
#### Surfaces
We also support the use of surfaces that are asynchronously loaded and support different color schemes

```javascript
viewer.addSurface($3Dmol.SurfaceType.VDW, {
    opacity:0.85,
    voldata: new $3Dmol.VolumeData(volumedata, "cube"),
    volscheme: new $3Dmol.Gradient.ROYGB(range[1],range[0])
},{});
```

#### Shapes
The use of different shapes and styles is supported.

![Alt Text](ReadMeIMGS/example3.png)

```javascript
viewer.addCylinder({start:{x:0.0,y:2.0,z:0.0},
    end:{x:0.0,y:10.0,z:0.0},
    radius:0.5,
    fromCap:false,
    toCap:true,
    color:'teal'});
viewer.addCylinder({start:{x:15.0,y:0.0,z:0.0},
    end:{x:20.0,y:0.0,z:0.0},
    radius:1.0,
    color:'black',
    fromCap:false,
    toCap:false});
```
